# XFL: Naming Functions in Binaries with Extreme Multi-label Learning

This repository contains the code accompanying the paper [_XFL: Naming Functions in Binaries with Extreme Multi-label Learning_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13404) by James Patrick-Evans, Moritz Dannehl and Johannes Kinder, which has been presented at the [IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy 2023](https://sp2023.ieee-security.org/index.html). 

## Overview

The repository consists of the following components:

* `xfl/` Partial source code of the implementation used for the paper, including full experiment data and logs.
* `xfl-r/` A refactored version of the original source code to simplify configuration and deployment (recommended).
* `lm/` The Language model for generating function names from lists of tokens predicted by XFL, as described in Section VI of the paper.

RevEng.AI offers a service to generate embeddings from symbols in binaries using the [reait](https://github.com/RevEngAI/reait) tool.
